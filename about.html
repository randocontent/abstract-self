						<h1>Abstract You</h1>

						<p>
							Abstract You is a reaction to the rapidly evolving phenomenon of
							creating
							<strong>human digital twins</strong>. At the core of this trend,
							is the desire to digitally sample and replicate not only a
							person’s physical traits, but also behavioral and emotional ones
							in order to create a virtual identical twin.
						</p>
						<p>
							But there is an inherent difficulty in the process of
							transforming someone into digital form. The technologies in use
							today are incapable of creating authentic and realistic digital
							twins. The assumption that human behavioural nuances and complex
							identity features (some of which are still elusive to us) can be
							sampled through analytical measures is misleading, and virtual
							entities created today might look like a specific person, but
							don’t ‘feel’ like that person. This dissonance creates a sense
							of eeriness in the observer, dropping the digital twin into the
							<strong>uncanny valley</strong>
							(Prof. Masahiro Mori, 1970). The twin is not perceived as an
							authentic and genuine manifestation of the actual person.
						</p>
						<p>
							Abstract You doubts the assumption that a hyper-realistic
							portrayal is necessarily the most authentic digital
							representation of a person. The project suggests that a basic
							and abstract visual manifestation might offer more potential for
							authenticity.
						</p>
						<p>
							In this project, an abstract form is created through an
							interface which samples three unique human attributes: body
							movement, facial emotion recognition and voice. These attributes
							are recorded, analysed in real-time using machine learning, and
							are then converted into an animated linear shape, a unique line
							for each person.
						</p>
						<p>
							The created visual is based on Köhler’s Gestalt theory
							experiment (Bouba/Kiki experiemnt), which shows the human
							ability to recognize different human traits in different
							abstract shapes.
						</p>
						<p class="bold">
							Abstract You offers an intuitive approach to transform a
							person from a physical entity into a digital one: an approach
							that asks not what do we see when encountering a person’s
							virtual image, but rather what do we ‘feel’.
